#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
A process of developing a software application using well defined principles methods and procedures: this resulta to efficient software.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference: This marked the formal recognition of software engineering as a discipline to address the software crisis.  

2.Structured Programming (1960s-1970s):Its introduction by pioneers like Edsger Dijkstra to improve code clarity and maintainability. 

3.Agile Manifesto (2001):It shifted focus to flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development, shaping modern software methodologies.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning – Define project scope, feasibility, and resources.  
2. Requirements Analysis – Gather and document software needs.  
3. Design – Create system architecture and technical specifications.  
4. Implementation (Coding) – Develop the software based on design.  
5. Testing – Identify and fix defects to ensure functionality.  
6. Deployment – Release the software for use.  
7. Maintenance – Update and fix issues post-deployment.  


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear, structured approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins. Best for well-defined, unchanging projects (e.g., construction, manufacturing) ;Agile is an An iterative, flexible approach with continuous feedback and adaptation. Best for dynamic projects with evolving requirements (e.g., software development, IT).  
Waterfall is rigid; Agile is adaptable.  
Waterfall requires extensive documentation; Agile focuses on working solutions.  
Waterfall involves customers early; Agile encourages ongoing collaboration.  


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developers design, code, and implement software solutions, collaborating with the team to ensure functionality. Quality Assurance Engineers test and monitor the development process to identify and fix issues, ensuring the final product meets quality standards. Project Managers oversee the entire development cycle, manage resources, mitigate risks, and ensure the project stays on schedule and within budget.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide an all-in-one development environment with tools for coding, debugging, and testing, improving efficiency and reducing errors. Examples include Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse. VCS tracks and manages code changes, enabling collaboration and version history, preventing data loss. Examples include Git, SVN, and Mercurial.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers struggle with rapid technological changes, complex codebases, and communication issues. Continuous learning, adopting modular code design, and using collaborative tools help mitigate these challenges.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing ensures individual components function correctly. Integration testing verifies interactions between components. System testing evaluates the complete system against requirements. Acceptance testing confirms the software meets user needs before deployment. These stages ensure software quality and reliability.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves crafting clear and precise inputs to guide AI models in generating relevant responses. Effective prompts improve the accuracy and usefulness of AI-generated content.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A vague prompt like "Tell me about Python" lacks direction. An improved prompt, such as "Provide an overview of Python, including key features and uses," results in a more focused and informative response by reducing ambiguity.
